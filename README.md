# Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation Project

## Introduction:

In today's health-conscious world, accurately identifying food items from images and estimating their calorie content is crucial for individuals managing their dietary intake. This project aims to develop a comprehensive model that achieves both food recognition and calorie estimation, enabling users to make informed food choices effectively.

## About the Dataset:

The dataset chosen for this project is Food-101, comprising over 100,000 food images categorized into 101 distinct classes. Each food category is organized into its own subfolder within a structured directory.

## Project Objectives:
The primary objectives of this project are twofold: first, to build a robust food recognition model capable of identifying various food items from images; and second, to develop a regression model that accurately predicts calorie values based on recognized food categories. By achieving these goals, users can better manage their dietary intake and make informed nutritional decisions.

## Methodology:

1. ### Data Preparation:
   - **Dataset:** Utilize the Food-101 dataset, loading images and corresponding labels (food categories) from the directory structure.
   - **Image Processing:** Implement functions to resize images to a specified size (e.g., 64x64 pixels) and gather them into arrays suitable for model training.
   - **Label Encoding:** Encode food category labels into integer values using LabelEncoder to facilitate model training with categorical data.
   - **Train-Test Split:** Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split to train the models effectively and evaluate their performance.

2. ### Food Recognition Model:
   - **Model Architecture:** Develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
   - **Training:** Train the CNN model over multiple epochs, monitoring loss and accuracy to optimize its performance in food recognition.
   - **Model Saving:** Save the trained food recognition model for future use and deployment.

3. ### Calorie Estimation Model:
   - **Regression Model Setup:** Build a regression model that predicts calorie values based on recognized food categories.
   - **Architecture:** Design the regression model with appropriate layers, culminating in a single output neuron for regression purposes.
   - **Training and Evaluation:** Train the regression model using prepared calorie labels, assessing its performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the test set.
   - **Model Saving:** Save the trained calorie estimation model as "calorie_model.task5" for practical applications and future reference.

## Expected Outcomes:
Upon completion of this project, users will benefit from:
- **Accurate Food Recognition:** The ability to identify various food items from images with high accuracy.
- **Precise Calorie Estimation:** Reliable predictions of calorie content based on recognized food categories.
- **Enhanced Dietary Management:** Empowering users to track their dietary intake effectively and make informed nutritional choices.

## Conclusion:
This project combines advanced image recognition techniques with regression modeling to provide a comprehensive solution for food recognition and calorie estimation. By leveraging these models, individuals can improve their dietary habits, maintain healthier lifestyles, and make informed decisions about their nutrition.
